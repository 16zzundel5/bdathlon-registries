# bdathlon-registries
BDAthlon question 4

The solution to this problem is located here: https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOLDesigner
You can download and play around with the tool here: https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOLDesigner/releases

Objecive 1: This tool that I have created can fetch parts from the SBOLStack, which in turn can fetch parts from the ICE registry (under development).  Therefore, one can browse and fetch parts from both repositories mentioned in the problem.  A tutorial of how this can be accomplished is located here: http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/SBOLDesigner

Objective 2: SBOLDesigner is similar to Genetic Constructor in that both tools allow fetching of parts from repositories.  Therefore, objective 2 is partially completed since we do have a tool that is connected to this "web of registries".  The tool is SBOLDesigner instead of Genetic Constructor.
